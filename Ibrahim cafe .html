            <H3>Step1</H3>
     <p>Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. 
      <br>Break 185g dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.</p>
         <h3> step 2</h3>
         <p>Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water.
          <br>Put over a low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to mix them.</p>
               <h3>step 3</h3>

              <p> Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High.<br> 
                Leave the melted mixture to cool to room temperature.</p>
             
                  <H3>Step4</H3>
                    
                    <p>While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. </p>
